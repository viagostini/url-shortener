# URL Shortener

This is a toy project for learning purposes. However, I am going to try to develop this like it is an actual project and try to move through an initial MVP phase and then maybe evolve from there as I see fit.

I'm going to try and work with PRs and stuff even though I'll be developing this by myself.

Note: there is an older version of this project already developed in the branch `old`.

### Idea
I want to develop a URL Shortener application like TinyURL. Users should be able to input the original URL they want to shorten and receive a shortened link that redirects to the original one when clicked.

Ideally, it should be able to have separate user accounts and be able to have limits, quotas, different plans, and other features that might depend on the user.

### MVP
For MVP purposes, I will only implement basic URL shortening functionality, with no regards to different users, authentication, or anything else.
